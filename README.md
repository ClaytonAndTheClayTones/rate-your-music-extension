I use this to look up "top albums of x genre in 2015" then keep track of which albums I do or don't like.  The only thing that sucks is that it's single-browser specific.   I will add documentation on how to transfer your likes/dislikes to another computer, should just be a file copy, but we can't use shared storage because it's limited to 512 entries.   I think you'll listen to more than 512 albums eventually.

Top 100 zydeco records,  GO!  

No.  Don't.  Don't do it.
